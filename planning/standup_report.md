##### **12pm Stand-up**

Discussion over feedback from Alex and Rane last night to refine the concept.

##### Idea

People matching service bringing people together using an activity to help people choose a good fit.

##### Key points of refinement and exploration for MVP


* Matching a host to an attendee based on a common shared experience or event.
* One on one (more post-MVP)
* Enable host/attendee two way communication.
* One event per page, swipe through to see selection.
* Events ordered by proximity
* Matching process


##### Key points for post-MVP

* Ability to hide 'seen' events
* Mark unseen events
* Developed two way communication to be more like messaging

####Afternoon aims:

* Draft data model
* Build boilerplate MEAN stack
* Build boilerplate ANGULAR front-end
* Draft user journey and pseudocode

####Afternoon conclusion:

* Draft data model - completed
* Build boilerplate MEAN stack - completed
* Build boilerplate ANGULAR front-end - completed (as much as possible
* Draft user journey and pseudocode - completed (as much as possible)

####Aims by Monday:

* Back-end authentication (Tom)
* Front-end authentication (Luca)
* User journey and wireframing (all team)
